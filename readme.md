> When should I take out the trash bins?

This script queries the ical files provided by the "[Stadtreinigung Leipzig](https://www.stadtreinigung-leipzig.de)", and outputs them as text.


You need the so called ``lid`` (Location ID â€“ 5 to 7 digit code). It can be obtained by querying the website manually.

I use the generated text to print it on my label printer, and put it next to the bins...
